When I was tinkering around with JTAG and BSDL files, I realized that there was no truly functional BSDL file parser for Python. Perhaps I simply didn't search hard enough. In any case, many packages are no longer up to date or have broken dependencies. Let's get our hands dirty - a few moments later and here is what I needed. If you can use it too, I'm happy to receive any inputs.

## Basic usage:
Download and install the package from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/cb-bsdl-parser/). It's recommended to install the package into a virtual Python environment.

```
pip install cb_bsdl_parser
```

There are two tools available to examine BSDL files:
- cb_bsdl_check: To check a BSDL file
- cb_bsdl_info: To get basic data and info from a BSDL file

```
cb_bsdl_check <bsdl_file> [options]
```

```
cb_bsdl_info <bsdl_file> [--cell CELL] [--print-bsr-table]
```

To use it in your Python project, create a BSDL object and extract the needed data:

```
bsdl = CBBsdl('bsdl_file.bsdl')

bsdl.get_entity_name()

# get the pin mapping as a dict:
pin_map = bsdl.get_pin_map()

# or just print the boundary scan table:
bsdl.print_bsr_table()
```

There is a handful of more methods available to extract other data from the BSDL file.

## Development

### Dev tool installation

The development is mainly being done on an Ubuntu 24.04 box. To set up a dev environment, use Python 3 and install the following packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

To use ```antlr4```, install it from the deb package sources/store:

```
sudo apt install antlr4
```
